## COVID-19 Case Prediction

## Introduction:

This model is bulit for the Prediction of COVID -19 Cases. In this pandemic situation it is necessary to have future information about the COVID-19.

## Model:
 Fisrt we have done the prediction using the _Polynomial Regression_ but due to accuracy at higher degree we have used the _ARMA and ARIMA Model_.
