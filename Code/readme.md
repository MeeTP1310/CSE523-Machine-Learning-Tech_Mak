# Code of COIVD-19 case Prediction

In this folder we have added the python codes of **Polymomial Regression** and **the ARMA and ARIMA models**.

1. polynomial.ipynb
   - In this file we have predict the covid-19 cases using _Polynomial Regression Model_.

2. arma.ipynb
   - In this file we have predict the covid-19 cases using _ARMA (Autoregressive Moving Average) Model_.

3. amima.ipynb
   - In this file we have predict the covid-19 cases using _ARMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) Model_.
